# Alice in Wonderland Text Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the text from Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland." Using a Jupyter notebook (`Alice.ipynb`), we explore various aspects of the text, including frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and other linguistic features. The text itself is provided in two formats: a plain text file (`alice.txt`) and a PDF document (`Alice.pdf`).

## Files

- `Alice.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for the analysis.
- `alice.txt`: The full text of "Alice in Wonderland" used for computational text analysis.

## Installation

- NLTK
- matplotlib
- pandas
- [Any additional libraries used in the notebook]

Use the following command to install the required libraries:
